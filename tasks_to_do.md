<h1>TAsks to do</h1>
<p>to make the first working version there is some task to do. When the basis is done, then we can modify the game and invent different rules. So these task should be done with keeping in mind, that code can be modified later</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose databases we need, make them and add to folder "databases" in this project</li>
<li>make main .py file in wich the game will run in terminal</li>
<li>make separate function .py files and with different purposes and add to folder "functions" they will be imported to the main file</li>
<li>invent info request system</li>
<li>player status display system (in terminal) text or, maybe, some graphical style using tables</li>
<li>make new database for final scores, maybe it can be even stored somewhere inthe internet to be reachable from different computers</li>
